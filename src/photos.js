The brand needed a new name and strategy to connect with China's millennial travellers, a community of 384 million and growing, bigger than the entire US population.For the rebrand of Airbnb in China – Ai Bi Ying which means “Welcome Each Other With Love”, AKQA Shanghai created an integrated campaign showing how travel opens us to a new world of love. All we have to do is welcome it.Through an anthem film, OOH and digital comms, we featured the unique homes, friendly hosts, vibrant neighbuorhoods, and unforgettable experiences you can book with Airbnb."
